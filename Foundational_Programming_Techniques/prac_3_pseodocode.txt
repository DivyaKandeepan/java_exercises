7. Output min
8. End

5)Pseudocode for swapping two numbers without using a third variable:

1. Input num1, num2
2. Set num1 = num1 + num2
3. Set num2 = num1 - num2
4. Set num1 = num1 - num2
5. Output num1, num2
6. End

6) Pseudocode for checking whether a number is a perfect square or not

1. Input number
2. Set squareRoot = square root of number (rounded to the nearest integer)
3. Set square = squareRoot * squareRoot
4. If square is equal to number, then:
     5. Output "The number is a perfect square"
   Else:
     6. Output "The number is not a perfect square"
7. End

7)Pseudocode for accepting a number from 1 to 7 and displaying the name of the week:

1. Input number
2. If number is 1, then:
     3. Output "Monday"
   Else if number is 2, then:
     4. Output "Tuesday"
   Else if number is 3, then:
     5. Output "Wednesday"
   Else if number is 4, then:
     6. Output "Thursday"
   Else if number is 5, then:
     7. Output "Friday"
   Else if number is 6, then:
     8. Output "Saturday"
   Else if number is 7, then:
     9. Output "Sunday"
   Else:
     10. Output "Invalid input"
11. End

8)Pseudocode for implementing a menu-driven calculator:

1. Output "1. Addition"
2. Output "2. Subtraction"
3. Output "3. Multiplication"
4. Output "4. Division"
5. Input choice
6. Input num1, num2
7. If choice is 1, then:
    
9)pseudocode for accepting student details, calculating the total and percentage, and displaying the pass or fail result based on the percentage:

1. Input student_id
2. Input student_name
3. Input student_age
4. Input mark1, mark2, mark3
5. Set total = mark1 + mark2 + mark3
6. Set percentage = (total / 300) * 100
7. If percentage > 50, then:
     8. Output "Result: Pass"
   Else:
     9. Output "Result: Fail"
10. End

10)pseudocode for printing the Fibonacci series up to 100

1. Set first = 0
2. Set second = 1
3. Print the first number of the series
4. Print the second number of the series
5. Set next = first + second  // Calculate the next number in the series
6. Repeat the following steps until next is less than or equal to 100:
     7. Output next  // Print the next number in the series
